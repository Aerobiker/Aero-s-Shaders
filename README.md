# Aero's Shaders
A repository of my own shaders for unity (optimized for VRC)

## Shaders

> âš  Some may have problems displaying in vr (since unity now uses a stereo camera)

- 7 Color Gradient
  + Creates a gradient in the x axis of the UV's, you can choose how many colors to consider for the gradient (the mixing is a bit wonkey)
- Aer Effects
  + Multi purpose shader, very capable, not very efficient. Just a mish mash of a lot of possible implementations
- Lens Distort
  + Simulates only on the visible side of the geometry, a distortion of the space behind it. (It is not ray tracing, so do not expect over realism)
- Super Emitter
  + Displays a image as if it was placed in the origin of the object or with an offset, (it renders in the volume of the object and can clip with its borders). The image always looks at the viewer. 
- Space Distortion
  + Using the same technique than the Super Emitter, you can distort space in the volume of an object, and make a black hole like effect, with distortion through time.
